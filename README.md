Problem Statement: 

X Education, an online education company catering to industry professionals, offers courses through its website. Professionals interested in these courses often visit the website and fill out a form, thereby becoming leads. The sales team follows up with these leads via calls and emails, aiming to convert them into customers. However, the current lead conversion rate is approximately 30%, meaning only 30 out of 100 daily leads typically convert.
To improve efficiency, X Education aims to identify the most promising leads, or "Hot Leads." By focusing their sales efforts on these leads, they aim to increase the conversion rate, reducing wasted effort on low-potential leads.

Business Objective:

X Education wants a predictive model that assigns each lead a score between 0 and 100, helping identify Hot Leads to boost conversion rates. The goal is to achieve a lead conversion rate of 80%.
The model should also account for future requirements, such as:
Strategies during peak times to maximize efficiency.
Optimal utilization of sales team resources.
Action plans for post-target achievement phases.
